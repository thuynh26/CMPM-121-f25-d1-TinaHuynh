# CMPM 121 D1 Project -- Cupid Clicker

A simple cupid themed incremental game inspired by Cookie Clicker.

Click to shoot cupid's arrows and send out love. Use those love hearts to buy upgrades and increase your love rate!

Peer inspired additions:
Added background gradient, changed button to an image, and gave image animation tweens when hovered and clicked. This was inspired by <https://github.com/wendyzh05/D1> and <https://github.com/t4ylo/cmpm-121-25-d1-taylorpearce>

Added sound to button on click that was inspired by <https://github.com/InvinciblePyro/syhaw-website>
